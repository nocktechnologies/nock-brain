"""Sidecar cache of verified attestation signatures for the recall hot path.

Verifying every fact's attestation inside budget-recall (the OWASP F5 closure)
costs ~160us per Ed25519 signature — ~0.4-0.8s over a 2,500-fact store, paid on
EVERY recall for inputs that almost never change between recalls, blowing the
memory-inject hook's <2s budget. This cache remembers which signature
determinations have already been made, so each one is verified once per
content change instead of once per recall. (The offline auditor,
verify-facts.py, deliberately never uses it: an audit always does the full
cryptographic pass. Callers that do use it go through for_store() so the
stat-before-read-then-save sequence is owned here, not choreographed at
each call site.)

What a cache entry means — and what stays uncached:

- A signature-op determination is recorded as an opaque digest binding the
  exact proof: an HMAC over (alg, key_id, signature, signed payload [, status
  for non-VALID]) KEYED under the verifying key material — see
  _sign.cache_digest. The payload embeds the attestation's committed
  fact/source hashes and the CURRENT parent hashes, so editing a fact's
  attested content, its evidence, a parent, the signature itself, or rotating
  the key all change the digest -> miss -> a real signature verification. The
  HMAC keying is what makes a forged sidecar useless without read access to
  the key file (see the threat model below).
- VALID proofs use the historical preimage (no status field) so existing
  sidecars keep hitting. PARENT_SUSPECT and signature-fail TAMPERED bind the
  status into the HMAC so an attacker-writable sidecar cannot upgrade a
  cached failure to VALID by rewriting the digest set. A later store change
  that repairs ancestry changes the payload's parent hashes -> miss ->
  re-verify, which is the required direction.
- The content-hash comparisons in _sign.verify_fact (recomputing the fact's
  canonical hash against the committed hash — the check that actually catches
  F5 content poisoning) run on EVERY recall regardless of cache state; a hit
  only skips the redundant public-key operation. A tampered fact is therefore
  detected immediately, warm cache or not.
- UNSIGNED results are never cached (no signature to digest). Committed-hash
  TAMPERED results are not cached either — those checks run every recall.

Store stamp: the sidecar records the store file's (mtime_ns, size), captured
BEFORE the store is read, as informational metadata only — it is NOT a hard
invalidation key. Digests are individually content-bound (each HMAC covers that
fact's committed hashes + current parent hashes), so a still-valid fact hits
even after an unrelated rewrite of facts.json (append, supersede, consolidate,
purge). Only the facts that actually changed miss and re-verify. A stamp
mismatch marks the handle dirty so save() can record the new stamp and prune.

What still discards the whole digest set (fail closed: doubt costs speed, never
safety): unreadable, oversized, malformed, wrong version, or wrong key. A
missing sidecar is a clean cold start, not doubt.

Growth bound: a dirty save persists only digests that were hit() or add()ed
during THIS run. Purged or pre-edit digests are not live this run, so they
drop instead of accumulating forever across store rewrites.

Concurrent saves: save() is load-modify-replace with no lock. Two recalls
racing a store rewrite (hook + budget-recall, or two Claude sessions) used
to last-writer-wins: a stale v1 handle would os.replace over a v2 sidecar
and the next recall would pay a cold verification. save() now re-stats the
store immediately before os.replace and skips when the stamp no longer
matches self.store_sig — the stale writer keeps its in-memory set but does
not clobber the newer sidecar. When the stamp still matches, save() re-reads
the sidecar and unions digests: within one store stat the set is append-only
(VALID and status-bound non-VALID share it; union cannot upgrade a failure
because non-VALID HMACs bind the status). Across stamps, skip-not-union
preserves the prune bound.

Unwritable store: load_for_store probes the sidecar directory once per
handle. If the directory is read-only or full, the handle stays usable
in memory (hit/add still skip redundant pubkey ops for the rest of this
recall and later recalls in the same process) but save() does not touch
disk. At most one diagnostic is printed per process — never one line per
recall — so a stuck store cannot fill hook-errors.log.

Threat model: the sidecar lives next to facts.json and is attacker-writable,
so a forged entry must never be able to mint a VALID result. It cannot: the
digest is an HMAC keyed under _sign.SigningKey.cache_key_material() (the raw
Ed25519 public-key bytes, or the HMAC secret), so computing a digest that
hit()s requires READING the key file — the very access that would let an
attacker delete/replace the key and disable verification anyway. A truncated,
public key_id is embedded in every attestation, but that alone is not enough to
key the HMAC, so an attacker with only facts.json (+ sidecar) write access —
the case that matters when the key lives on a protected path via
NOCKBRAIN_SIGNING_PUB/KEY — cannot forge a bypass. (An earlier design keyed the
digest on public inputs only and WAS forgeable in that split-key posture, even
under --strict-verify; the HMAC keying closes it, and CACHE_VERSION was bumped
so pre-fix sidecars are rejected.) The sidecar holds only opaque digests, no
fact content. purge-fact unlinks the sidecar wholesale (no fact-id mapping
to drop rows) and the next recall cold-starts; a dirty save still prunes
to this-run live set if the sidecar is left in place.

    """present / fresh / writable / reason for nockbrain-health.

    A missing sidecar is a cold start, not an outage. An uncreated
    parent directory is the same case: writable is False (nowhere to
    persist) but flagged is False (not an outage). An unwritable
    existing parent is the silent degradation this surfaces: every new
    process re-verifies. Fresh means the sidecar's recorded store stamp
    matches the current store (mtime_ns, size) — informational after
    per-entry retention.

    When present but not fresh, reason names why: "stale_stamp" (the
    recorded stamp moved), "oversized" (refused unread), or
    "unreadable" (read or parse failure). reason is None when the
    sidecar is fresh or absent — absence is not a not-fresh reason.
