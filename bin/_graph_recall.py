"""Graph-augmented recall traversal (Graphify merge into budget-recall).

This module holds the ONLY graph-expansion logic. It is invoked from
budget-recall.py's `_maybe_graph_expand()` and is reached *only* when the
graph flag is on — the off-path never imports or calls anything here.

The graph itself is built by `export-graph.graph_from_facts()` VERBATIM (we do
not reinvent concept extraction). We read its MENTIONS edges (fact -> concept)
and SUPPORTS edges (session -> fact) to find facts that neighbor a flat BM25 hit
without sharing any query term. Those neighbors are weighted strictly BELOW the
weakest flat hit, re-using the SAME confidence / recency / supersession gates as
`search()`, and the seeds are always emitted first in their original order so
expansion is strictly additive.
