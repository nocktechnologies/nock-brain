"""Hybrid semantic recall: RRF fusion of BM25 seeds with dense candidates.

Phase 2 of docs/specs/2026-07-10-semantic-recall-hybrid-design.md, carrying
the Phase 0 amendments. Invoked ONLY from budget-recall's
`_maybe_dense_fuse()` when the semantic flag is on — the off-path never
imports this module.

Design points, each measured in the Phase 0 spike:

- Dense candidates rank by RAW cosine with FILTER-only gates (superseded /
  validity / min-confidence). Multiplying cosine by recency demolished a
  perfect paraphrase match: cosine lives in a ~0.2-0.6 band, so a 0.44
  recency factor buries it under recent noise. Recency stays a lexical-side
  and selection-time concern.
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60) merges the two lists without score
  calibration. Seeds that also appear dense collect both terms.
- RRF alone under-serves strong dense-only hits on noisy stores (a dense
  rank-3 hit fused to 24), so the top RESERVED_SLOTS dense-only facts are
  nominated as reserved: budget-recall guarantees them injection and exempts
  them from the date diversity cap.
- Vectors whose stored content hash no longer matches the live fact are
  stale and skipped — the sidecar is derived data, never authoritative.

Any unavailability (numpy/tokenizers missing, no model assets, no or
mismatched sidecar) degrades silently to the BM25 seeds; a one-line note
goes to stderr, which the injection hook keeps out of sessions.
