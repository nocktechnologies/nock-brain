"""Projection readback receipts (S4).

A derived/projection write can silently fail or go stale and nothing notices —
the exact class of failure that froze Mira's memory for three days. The fix
(Mnemosyne/harness pattern): every projection write becomes a LEDGER ROW that
is only marked "applied" after the written file is READ BACK and its content
hash matches what was intended. When readback does not match, the row is
"ambiguous" — a first-class outcome, never a silent success and never a raise.

Dependency-free and Python-3.9 importable (deferred annotations, no evaluated
PEP 604 unions) so the exporters — including the recall-reachable graph export
— can share it. Receipts append to a projection-receipts.jsonl next to the
store, mirroring recall-degradations.jsonl.
"""
