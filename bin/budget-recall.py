# source_date is OVER-REPRESENTED in the *candidate corpus* of a query, so no
# single date can monopolize ranking. Conservative by construction: it triggers
# ONLY above a share threshold and is floored, so a normal date (a few % of the

# --- Attestation verification on the recall hot path (OWASP F5 / N8068) -----
# The signed fact envelope (_sign.py) made tampering with facts.json
# *detectable*, but detection only ran in the offline verify-facts.py CLI — the
# recall path that actually injects facts into live sessions never checked it,
# so a poisoned store would be injected undetected. Close that loop here: when
# signing has been set up (a key exists), every loaded fact is verified and
# TAMPERED facts are dropped before ranking, with a one-line stderr count (the
# injection hook discards stderr, so the warning can never leak into a
# session). Unsigned facts stay recallable by default — much of the store
# predates signing — but are counted in the warning; --strict-verify fails
# closed and keeps only VALID facts. No key on disk means verification is
# skipped entirely (pre-signing behavior, and _sign/cryptography are never
# imported, keeping the no-key hot path cost-free).
#
# Cost control: at ~160us per Ed25519 signature, full verification of a
# 2,500-fact store adds ~0.4-0.8s to every recall — most of the hook's <2s
# budget. A sidecar cache (_verify_cache) remembers already-proven signatures
# per store, guarded by the store file's (mtime_ns, size), so a recall over an
# unchanged store skips the signature operations but STILL recomputes and
# compares every fact's committed content hashes — tampering is detected even
# on a warm cache, and any cache doubt falls back to full verification.
